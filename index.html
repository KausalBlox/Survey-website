                <h3>Help Shape a Sustainable Future</h3>
                <p>
                    Climate change and environmental degradation are among the most pressing challenges of our time. 
                    As we face rising temperatures, increasing pollution, and diminishing natural resources, 
                    understanding community perspectives on sustainability practices becomes crucial for developing 
                    effective solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This survey aims to gather insights from the Australian community about current environmental 
                    awareness, sustainable practices, and barriers to eco-friendly living. Your responses will help 
                    CQU researchers identify trends, challenges, and opportunities in promoting sustainable lifestyles 
                    across different demographics and regions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The survey takes approximately 5-7 minutes to complete and covers topics including daily 
                    environmental practices, energy usage, transportation choices, and future sustainability goals. 
                    Your participation will contribute to valuable research that may influence policy recommendations 
                    and community education programs focused on environmental protection and sustainable development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All responses are anonymous and will be used solely for research purposes. Thank you for taking 
                    the time to share your perspectives and help us work towards a more sustainable future for Australia.
                </p>
